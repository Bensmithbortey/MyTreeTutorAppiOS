Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
And sorry <b>I could not travel both</b>
And be one traveler, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br>

<i>Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one less traveled by,
And that has made all the difference.</i>
