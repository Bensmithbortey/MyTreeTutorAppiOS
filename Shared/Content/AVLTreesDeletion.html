            <h4 class="main-sub-heading">To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every deletion, we must augment the standard BST delete operation to perform some re-balancing. Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) &lt; key(root) &lt; keys(right)).</h4>

                <div class="list">
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>1)</span> Perform standard BST delete for w.</li>
                        <li><span>2)</span> Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the larger height child of z, and x be the larger height child of y. Note that the definitions of x and y are different from <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/avl-tree-set-1-insertion/">insertion </a>here.</li>
                        <li><span>3)</span> Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>a)</span> y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)</li>
                        <li><span>b)</span> y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)</li>
                        <li><span>c)</span> y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)</li>
                        <li><span>d)</span> y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="main-sub-heading padding-top-2">Like insertion, following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. Note that, unlike insertion, fixing the node z won&rsquo;t fix the complete AVL tree. After fixing z, we may have to fix ancestors of z as well (See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbvhGcf6UJU">this video lecture</a> for proof)</p>

We mark it as z, its higher height child as y which is 62, and y&rsquo;s higher height child as x which could be either 78 or 50 as both are of same height. We have considered 78. Now the case is Right Right, so we perform left rotation.</p>
