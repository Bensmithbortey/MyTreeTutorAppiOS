Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) &lt; key(root) &lt; keys(right)).</h4>

                        <li><span>3)</span> Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements:</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span>a)</span> y is left child of z and x is left child of y (Left Left Case)</li>
                        <li><span>b)</span> y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case)</li>
                        <li><span>c)</span> y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case)</li>
                        <li><span>d)</span> y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case)</li>

In all of the cases, we only need to re-balance the subtree rooted with z and the complete tree becomes balanced as the height of subtree (After appropriate rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it was before insertion.</p>
