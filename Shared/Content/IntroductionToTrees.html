                <p class="main-sub-heading width-100">A binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operations are as fast as in a linked list.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><span>Path -</span> Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.</li>
                        <li><span>Root -</span> The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.</li>
                        <li><span>Parent -</span> Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.</li>
                        <li><span>Child -</span> The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.</li>
                        <li><span>Leaf -</span> The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.</li>
                        <li><span>Subtree -</span> Subtree represents the descendants of a node..</li>
                        <li><span>Visiting -</span> Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.</li>
                        <li><span>Traversing -</span> Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.</li>
                        <li><span>Levels -</span> Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.</li>
                        <li><span>keys -</span> Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.</li>
